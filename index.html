				The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun
				and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of
				the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the
				eight planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, the
				dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that
				orbit the Sun indirectly—the natural satellites—two are larger
				than the <em>smallest planet</em>, Mercury.

						Mercury (0.4 AU from the Sun) is the closest planet to
						the Sun and on average, all seven other planets. The
						smallest planet in the Solar System (0.055 M⊕), Mercury
						has no natural satellites. Besides impact craters, its
						only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes
						that were probably produced by a period of contraction
						early in its history.

						Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named
						after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the
						brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the
						Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare
						occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.
						Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to
						venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west
						just after dusk or rising in the east a little while
						before dawn.
